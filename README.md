# Art Gobblers • [![CI](https://github.com/artgobblers/art-gobblers/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/artgobblers/art-gobblers/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Art Gobblers is an experimental decentralized art factory by Justin Roiland and Paradigm.

## Background

Art Gobblers is a decentralized art factory owned by aliens. As artists make cool art, Gobblers gains cultural relevance, making collectors want the art more, incentivizing artists to make cooler art. It's also an on-chain game.

See our [overview of the system](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/artgobblers), as well as deep dives into some the project's mechanisms, like [GOO](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/goo) and [VRGDAs](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda).

## Deployments

TBD

```

### Run Tests

In order to run unit tests, run: 

```sh
forge test
```

For longer fuzz campaigns, run: 

```sh
FOUNDRY_PROFILE="intense" forge test
```

For differential fuzzing against a python implementation, see [here](./analysis/README.md).
